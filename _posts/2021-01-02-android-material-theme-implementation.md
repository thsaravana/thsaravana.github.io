<h2>Styles vs Themes</h2>
Perhaps the important reason for confusing themes with styles, is due to the fact that
both of these are represented by the `<style>` tag. 

|                    Style                    |                Theme               |
|:-------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
| view attributes                             | theme attributes                   |
| applied to single view                      | applied to context, view           |
| doesn't inherit from higher up in hierarchy | supports inheritance and overrides |
